# Patient Zero

A short game jam made with Godot 4 for [GMTK Game Jam
2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2907261).

[Play online or download](https://mgiuca.itch.io/patient-zero).

I have published the source code for anybody interested. I likely won't keep
working on this version of the game, but perhaps some day will turn it into a
full game.

All of the code was written by me, Matt Giuca. Licensed under the [MIT

places online and licensed appropriately: see [Credits](credits.md) for details.
